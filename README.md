This is a practice [Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/) project where I applied my exploratory data analysis and the foundational Python skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python by manipulating and visualizing movie data.

**Netflix**! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex my **exploratory data analysis** skills and dive into the entertainment industry.

Here, I work for a production company that specializes in nostalgic styles. I want to do some research on movies released in the 1990's. I delved into Netflix data and perform exploratory data analysis to better understand this awesome movie decade!

I worked with the dataset `netflix_data.csv`, along with the following table detailing the column names and descriptions.

## The data ðŸ“‘
### **netflix_data.csv**
| Column | Description |
